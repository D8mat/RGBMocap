# Motion correction: contributor build

The editable C++ and Python source is **`../../third_party/KimodoMotionCorrection/`**. This is the single canonical copy of the modified NVIDIA Kimodo MotionCorrection source; see its `UPSTREAM.json`, `LICENSE`, `notices/`, `CMakeLists.txt` and `src/cpp/`. It includes RGB MoCap's anatomical and contact changes. Do not replace it with an unmodified upstream build.

The checked-in `../../prebuilt/motion-correction/_motion_correction.cp310-win_amd64.pyd` is the installed Windows x64, CPython 3.10 binary. The installer validates its size and SHA-256, then copies it into the private runtime's correction directory. Blender and FFmpeg are downloaded from their respective providers and are not in this folder.

To build a candidate, first run `install.cmd`, install a C++17 compiler (Visual Studio Build Tools recommended), CMake >= 3.15 and Git, and ensure the bootstrap Python under `.setup/python/` remains installed. It supplies the Python 3.10 development libraries and setuptools; the runtime itself does not contain all build libraries. Run `build.cmd`. CMake may fetch pinned pybind11 and Eigen sources, subject to their licenses. Build output is written under `.setup/motion-correction-build/`; this does not replace the installed or checked-in binary. On Windows with MSVC, the compiler environment must be configured. The provided CMake build enables AVX; compatibility with processors without AVX has not been established.

Before proposing a new prebuilt binary, test import and contact correction using the app's Python 3.10 runtime, run the motion/contact regressions for all supported models, document compiler/dependency versions and reproduce the build independently. Then update the binary hash and size in both `installer/git-support-lock.json` and `installer/source-resources.json`. Binary equivalence and newly compiled build portability are not assumed.
